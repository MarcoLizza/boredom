# BOREDOM

## INTRODUCTION

This is my own personal interpretation of the January 2016 [#1GAM](http://onegameamonth.com) game-jam theme.

The theme was set to **HOBBY**, so I though of creating some sort of remake of [Little Computer People](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_People).

## GAME STATUS

The game (would you call that?) is an early prototype far from being complete. Although the mechanics are working it lacks in polishment and refinement. Most notably the graphic is just a little nicer than a rough draft, and there's no sound at all.

I plan (hope) to tweak the game in the future and fill those gaps.

## INSTRUCTIONS

While in the original game you avatar was, to some degree, behaving on free-will and you were interacting with him/her by typing on a input console), in **BOREDOM** you are controlling you avatar directly by moving it on the map with the arrow keys. Interact with the map with the `X` and `C` keys.

Indulge in your hobbies, do the chores, go to work. Organize yourself and keep on playing as long as possible. Keep an eye on your avatar attributes, 'tough! The game ends when one of them reaches `-10`.

## TOOLS

The game has been developed with [L&Ouml;VE](https://love2d.org/) framework (version 0.10.0). The graphics have been drawn with [Pyxel Edit](http://pyxeledit.com/). Coding and debugging has been conducted with [Zero-Brane Studio IDE](http://studio.zerobrane.com/) and [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

No other external/third-party libraries have been adopted.
